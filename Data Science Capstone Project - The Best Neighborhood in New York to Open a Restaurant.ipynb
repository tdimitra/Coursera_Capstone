    "It's a beautiful summer day in New York and as you are sitting at a restaurant for brunch with your friends, you are discussing your plans/dream to start your own restaurant business. At first, from your own experience, you propose that SoHo would be the ideal neighborhood to open your new restaurant. Meanwhile, your friends insist that maybe Midtown or the Financial District would be a greater place. You have a heated debate over the optimal neighborhood for starting your business. However, you all agree on the fact that the business should be located at a safe part of the city, and in a spot where there are people that usually hang out all days and times of the week. \n",
